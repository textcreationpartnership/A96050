            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>EVer ſince my laſt accompt of the State of Lyme, I have continued here for incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement thereof, and in the intervening time have obſerved theſe occurrences; That the enemy hath in theſe five daies laſt paſt ſhot many vollies of great and ſmall ſhot in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Towne, which the beſieged have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; and anſwered with equall courage as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. On the twelfth inſtant, I furniſhed the Towne with ten barrells of Powder, their ſtore being neere exhauſted. On the thirteenth they tooke a priſoner, who gave information that the Lord <hi>Hopton</hi> had been in the Leaguer
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:155180:3"/>laſt Sabbath-Day, and demanded five men out of every Company, which he promiſed to make good by an equall number of preſt men, but they were denyed him. From thence (as I heard by one of the Frigots that came from the Weſt on Munday laſt) he went to Dart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth, whether he came in on Thurſday night with ſeven horſe, giving out that he was to raiſe an Army of fifteene thouſand men. The ſaid thirteenth inſtant, upon deſire from the Counſell of Warre in Lyme, I reſolved to ſent the Boates and ſmall Veſſells here to give an Alarme on the Eaſt part of Lyme for diſtracting of the enemy, and drawing him off from the Towne (notice being given of the ſouldiers affrightment, with what was formerly done in the like kind) which was yeſterday put in execution accordingly; the Seamen landing and marching up into the Country, which cauſed the horſe and foote that came downe to attend them to fly to the Hills, and gave the Seamen opportunity to converſe with many of the Country peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, who have appeared generally well af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:155180:3"/>to the Parliament, in reſpect of the great preſſures laid upon them by a beggerly and cruell enemy. By ſome of them I recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved notice that the Lord <hi>Hopton</hi> had two daies before commanded all there abouts, from ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene to ſixty, to repaire forthwith to Dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter, with ſuch armes as they could pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide; as alſo with victualls and money, to withſtand ſome forces expected there ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; under command of his Excellency, or ſir <hi>William Waller,</hi> and that ſome hundreds men had been preſt for his ſervice, who had neare all of them made an eſcape. Yeſterday there came aboard me one Lieutenant <hi>Farre,</hi> of the Lord <hi>Broghills</hi> Regiment, and his Enſigne, who had the night before they came into Lyme two and twenty of the ſouldiers under his care. By him I received Intelligence that Prince <hi>Maurice</hi> had ſome notice of ſome forces comming to Dorcheſter; That the Queen was about ten daies agoe brought to bed at Exeter of a Boy. That many of the Princes Army were ready to come into Lyme, as they could gaine a conveniency. This mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:155180:4"/>about two of the clock my boate came from the Town, with advice that the enemy was drawing off his great Guns, and rayſing his ſiege, which by letters received this day from the Governour was confirmed. The Prince withdrawing himſelfe laſt night a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout five of the clocke, and the Army ſtealing away about two of the clock this morning. At noone I went on ſhoare, and viewing the workes, I found the enemy to be contrived with ſtrength and much advantage, but the Towneſmen ſo ſlight, that its neare a miracle they ſhould hold out ſo long againſt ſo vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and reſolved an enemy. The truth is, next to the protection of Heaven, the courage and honeſty of the Officers and Souldiers were in a manner their ſole defence, they being made inſtrumentall, and through Gods blesſing to the preſerving of them in ſafety and cheere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe.</p>
            <p>When I came amongſt the Officers, I found them all worthy of precious eſteem, and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtly ſubmitting to the many Inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, which a long and hard Siege had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:155180:4"/>and that nothing is wanting to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them ſpecially ſerviceable abroad, but money, for ſupply whereof they deſired me to be an humble Remembrancer, which I need not to ſecond with any Argument beſides their own merit, whereof I know the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment will be very ſenſible, conſidering the great Advantages that will depend upon their fidelity: I received lately a deſire from Plymouth, to move the Parliament for ſome Money for their Garriſon, they having no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect to hinder their marching forth, but of that and a Governour. On Tueſday Sir <hi>Iohn Bamfield,</hi> Colonell <hi>Carre,</hi> and their Officers came into this road; and went away in the <hi>Hector</hi> the ſame night: And ſo, that I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe they are before this time ſafely landed at their intended Port: I heard a report at Lyme this day, that Weymouth is delivered up to the Parliament, and ſome Carriages were obſerved this day to paſſe from that ſide towards Exeter; How far that Report may be credited, or another, that Prince <hi>Charles</hi> was lately at Weymouth, I know not: But
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:155180:5"/>I have renewed my command at the Ships attending that Road, to have a ſpeciall eye on all Veſſells that come from thoſe parts. Of theſe things I thought fit to give advertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to your Lordſhip, that the ſame may be communicable to the Houſe of Peers, of whoſe commands I ſhall be moſt faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully obſervant; Reſting,</p>
